Swasti Token (SWAT) is a New World Order Cryptocurrency based on a BEP-20 protocol

SWAT is a cryptocurrency that has been developed by a team of qualified psychologists, who want to improve the mental health of people all over the world. This token is unique, because it is not about money. Swasti is about reaching out to people and helping them through difficult times. We want to create a community where people receive all the support and care they need. We want to empower SWAT holders to become skilled supporters who can take care of new members. 

New World Order will consist of specific goals that SWAT community will try to achieve. The current number one goal of Swasti Token is to improve men's mental health, and make sure that men are again strong and capable to take care of their own lives and the lives of others. Other, upcoming goals will be associated by special events and will be related to unity of the world and spiritual wellbeing of humanity. Stay tuned and join our Telegram Chat.

We want to restore the good name of Swastika symbol as it is one of the oldest universal symbols that has a deep meaning. The word swastika comes from Sanskrit: स्वस्तिक [svastika] meaning "conducive to well-being". In Hinduism, the right-facing symbol (clockwise) (卐) is called swastika, symbolizing surya ("sun"), prosperity and good luck. Hitler has corrupted this symbol, so we will bring it back to its good dignity!

The use cases will be associated with various mental health services and other businesses and organisations that are interested in a new healthy world!
